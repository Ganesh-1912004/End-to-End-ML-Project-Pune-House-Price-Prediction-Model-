# End-to-End ML Project: Pune House Price Prediction Model

## Introduction
The Pune House Price Prediction Model is a comprehensive machine learning project designed to predict house prices in Pune, India. Utilizing features such as location, number of bedrooms (BHK), number of bathrooms, and total square footage, the model employs Ridge, Linear, and Lasso regression techniques for accurate predictions. The model is deployed using Flask, providing a seamless user experience through a web interface.

## Features
- **House Price Prediction**: Input features such as location, BHK, bathrooms, and total square footage to get predicted prices.
- **User-Friendly Web Interface**: Developed with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for ease of use.
- **Flask Backend**: Manages predictions and serves the web interface.
- **Pre-Trained Models**: Utilizes pre-trained Ridge, Linear, and Lasso regression models for robust predictions.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection**: The dataset was sourced from Kaggle.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Included handling null values, detecting outliers, and analyzing correlations with the target variable.
3. **Model Training**: Applied Linear, Ridge, and Lasso regression models to train the dataset and predict house prices.
4. **Data Visualization**: Utilized libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizing data patterns and model insights.
5. **Prediction**: Deployed the trained models to predict house prices based on input features.
6. **Web Interface Development**: Created a user-friendly web interface using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for input and display of predictions.
7. **Backend Development**: Developed a Flask application to handle prediction requests and serve the web interface efficiently.

## Installation and Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:
